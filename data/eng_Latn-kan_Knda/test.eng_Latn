POTATO

Potato is an important vegetable crop of Dharwad and Belagavi districts of northern Karnataka grown in kharif season. Fertile, well drained, black and sand mixed soil is most suited for potato cultivation. Ill drained and waterlogged lands are not suitable for its cultivation. Avoid growing potato in the same field where tomato/ brinjal/ chilli / tobacco are grown during previous seasons.

Selection of seed tubers

Select certified and disease free seed tubers for sowing. Non-dormant tubers must be used for sowing. If the tubers are big, cut them into pieces such that at least two swollen buds/ eyes are present in each cut tuber and each weighs approximately 35-40 g.

Planting

Prepare the land by deep ploughing 2 to 3 times. Apply recommended dose of FYM and incorporate into the soil. Prepare a mixture of Azospirillum, phosphorus solubilizing bacterium and Trichoderma harzianum in water. Dip the seed tubers in this mixture before planting. Prepare ridges and furrows with a spacing of 60 cm and apply green manure and vermicompost in the planting lines and incorporate into the soil. Plant the tubers at 20 cm spacing along the planting line.

Intercultivation

Intercultivate and earthen up after 30 and 45 days of planting. This will ensure weed control, better tuber improvement and helps in preventing tubers turning green.

After intercultivation, remove the remaining weeds by hand weeding.

Foliar Spray

After 30 and 45 days of planting, foliar spray of panchagavya (@ 3%) + cow urine (@ 10%) on the foliage.

Plant protection measures

Spray 5% NSKE (Preparation method is given on page number 50) or Nomuraea rileyi (@ 1 gm/lit.) mixed with 0.1% Tween 80 to control leaf eating insect pests.

To control shoot borer damage, remove and destroy the drying shoots and release the egg parasite Trichograma chilonis @ 20,000/acre each time for 2 to 3 times.

Harvest and yield

The crop will be ready for harvest in 75 to 80 days. When stem and leaves turn yellow and start drying, cut the top leaves and harvest after 10 days. This will help in thickening of tuber skin and favour longer shelf life. Dig and harvest the tubers at optimum soil moisture without damaging them. Spread the harvested tubers in dry and well ventilated place for 10-15 days. Do not use potato leaves for storing harvested tubers.
